# hello-world
Steve here. I have written software for 50 years -- lots of changes :-).  I still prefer Ada over C++, particularly Ada2012 with its pre and post conditions for verification.  Also like Perl.  Java isn't too bad and JavaScript was fun for programming a Sudoku solver, but I still find Ada to allow me to write code with the greatest integrity.  By integrity, I mean the code can be understood, modified without collapsing, and expresses in detail the intentions of the code.  
Learning Nodejs at the moment.
